# Changelog

All notable changes to the official oh-my-niu bundle are recorded here.
Release entries describe bundle artifacts, host compatibility, permission
changes, and user-visible asset changes.

## 2.0.0 (unreleased)

- Release artifact: `oh-my-niu-2.0.0.zip` (`api = "niubash:plugin-bundle@0.1.0"`,
  `min_niubash = "1.0.0"`).
- Host compatibility: the `git` prompt segment (`[segments.git] id = "vcs"`
  in `prompts/segments.toml`) now resolves to niubash's native
  `SegmentId::Vcs` as of niubash 1.4.1 — branch / `branch*` / short SHA,
  themed `[git_clean]` cyan / `[git_dirty]` yellow, rendered in-process with
  zero child git processes. No bundle format change: every shipped preset
  already carries the segment (the `lean` preset is the documented showcase).
- Compatibility audit against niubash master (post-1.4.4, 2026-10-25):
  the built-in plugin/theme stack this bundle was originally designed
  against was retired by Niubash (niubash#145), so the framework now
  wires its own lifecycle onto the bash prompt surface — `precmd` and
  `chpwd` dispatch from `PROMPT_COMMAND`, `preexec` from the DEBUG
  trap — and `prompt-core` publishes the rendered prompt to `PS1`
  itself instead of relying on a host bridge consuming
  `NIU_PROMPT_LEFT`. The entry point no longer derives bundle paths
  from an unset `HOME` (niubash#546). Documentation (README,
  compatibility, migration, authoring, design notes) was aligned with
  the current host: rc is `~/.niubashrc`-only (legacy winshrc files
  are never read), plugin CLI state lives in `~/.niubash/plugins.toml`,
  bundle updates are manual, and the retired `niu plugin` bundle verbs
  were removed from the guides. The framework smoke harness now
  reloads the entry point explicitly (`--reload`) and asserts the
  hook wiring end to end.
- Renamed the bundle from `oh-my-winuxsh` to `oh-my-niu` to match the
  niubash 1.0.0 brand. Installed `~/.oh-my-winuxsh` directories keep
  working as bundle roots — point `NIUBASH` at the old tree and source
  its entry point. Current Niubash has no bundle discovery of its own
  and reads neither layout.
- Bundle/plugin API identifiers move from the `winuxsh:` prefix to
  `niubash:` (`niubash:plugin-bundle@0.1.0`, `niubash:plugin@0.1.0`,
  `niubash:plugin-index@0.1.0`). Manifests may declare either
  `min_niubash` or the legacy `min_winuxsh` field.
- Entry point renamed to `oh-my-niu.niu`; scripts now use the `NIU_*`
  environment prefix (`NIU_PLUGINS`, `NIU_THEME`, `NIU_THEME_PLUGIN`)
  and the `NIUBASH` bundle-root variable.
- New first-party plugins: `command-timer` (per-command duration and exit
  code), `auto-env` (automatic `.venv` activation per directory),
  `dirmarks` (directory bookmarks), `git-fetch-reminder` (upstream
  divergence notices), and `env-sync` (push/pull shell config and the WPM
  package manifest through any rclone remote).
- All first-party pack manifests move to version 2.0.0 to match the
  bundle release.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Released first-party `.winux` source packs for Git, Docker, kubectl, npm,
  zoxide, direnv, dotenv, fzf, last-working-dir, and thefuck against the
  Winuxsh source lifecycle host.
- Added the framework entry point, directory-first official plugins,
  `prompt-core`, and theme plugins for minimal, classic, pure, compact,
  cyberpunk, forest, and ocean.
- Kept keybindings and command-not-found as bridge plugins while their low-level
  Reedline/provider call sites remain host-owned.
- Kept old `packs/` manifests as compatibility and package-review metadata over
  the directory plugin surface.
- Added `tools/smoke_framework.winux` for runtime verification with an
  installed Winuxsh binary.
- Updated bundle metadata with `api = "winuxsh:plugin-bundle@0.1.0"` and
  `min_winuxsh = "0.10.0"` so older Winuxsh hosts refuse this RC-first
  source-pack bundle.
- Added deterministic release packaging for `oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip` and the
  matching `.sha256` checksum file.

### Compatibility

- Requires Winuxsh 0.10.0 or newer for source plugin startup and lifecycle hook
  loading through `.winux` files.
- Keeps process and WASM plugin protocols unchanged; WASM provider/effect APIs
  remain future host work.

### Release Checklist

- Attach `oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip` and
  `oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip.sha256` to the GitHub release.
- Include this changelog entry and `docs/compatibility.md` in the release notes.
- Run `python tools/validate_bundle.py` and
  `python tools/package_bundle.py --check` before publishing.
- Run `winuxsh tools/smoke_framework.winux .` before publishing framework
  changes.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Established the repository as the official Winuxsh plugin bundle rather than
  a legacy `.winsh` script framework.
- Added bundle metadata with `api = "winuxsh:plugin-bundle@0.1.0"` and
  `min_winuxsh = "0.8.3"`.
- Added first-party source packs for Git, Docker, kubectl, npm, zoxide,
  direnv, dotenv, fzf, last-working-dir, and thefuck with bundle-local `.winux`
  startup and lifecycle hook code.
- Added first-party builtin/native packs for command-not-found, prompts, and
  keybindings where host-owned provider/editor/prompt behavior still applies.
- Added bundle-owned aliases, completions, prompt presets, keybinding metadata,
  official theme assets, authoring templates, and public authoring documentation.
- Added deterministic release packaging for `oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.0.zip` and the
  matching `.sha256` checksum file.

### Compatibility

- Requires Winuxsh 0.8.3 or newer for local bundle install, rollback, doctor,
  review, process plugin, and Phase 8 WASM command execution support.
- Uses pack manifest API `winuxsh:plugin@0.1.0`, process plugin protocol
  `winuxsh:process-plugin@0.1.0`, and WASM plugin protocol
  `winuxsh:wasm-plugin@0.1.0`.
- Keeps source, process, and WASM execution visible through manifest
  permissions because they can execute outside pure static asset loading.

### Release Checklist

- Attach `oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.0.zip` and
  `oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.0.zip.sha256` to the GitHub release.
- Include this changelog entry and `docs/compatibility.md` in the release notes.
- Run `python tools/validate_bundle.py` and
  `python tools/package_bundle.py --check` before publishing.
